On February 24, 2021, the Hong Kong financial secretary, Paul Chan Mo-po, released his fifth Hong Kong budget speech during his term of office. He said “this year's Budget focuses on stabilising the economy and relieving people's burden. It aims to alleviate the hardship and pressure caused by the economic downturn and the epidemic through the introduction of counter-cyclical measures costing over $120 billion; and seeks to create a leverage effect to benefit our people, workers as well as enterprises”.

In 2020, counter-cyclical measures of a massive scale involving above $120 billion was introduced in the Hong Kong budget proposal. Paul stated that “In preparing this Budget, I put the focus on ‘supporting enterprises, safeguarding jobs, stimulating the economy and relieving people's burden’. I am well aware that financial resources alone are not enough to tackle the challenges we are facing”.

From the budget speeches of the financial secretary from 2020 to 2021, we can easily find that the focuses of Hong Kong's budget in the past two years are both on boosting the economy and relieving the people's hardship, especially on supporting enterprises and ensuring employment by proposing counter-cyclical measures of $120 billion. 

As an important offshore financial center, Hong Kong has always been practicing free marketism. As an institution serving the market, Hong Kong government releases its budget proposal every year according to the market situation and tax situation. If the financial situation permits, the budget will also provide a series of tax and fee relief measures to reduce the economic pressure of residents and help citizens rich. Therefore, Hong Kong budget is particularly important to understand the economic situation of Hong Kong, and we scraped latest 20 years’ Hong Kong budget speech from the official website for text mining, trying to find out the key words in 20-year budget and how they changed, what topics the budget speech focused on and how funds were allocated in these aspects.

In order to better understand the Hong Kong budget, we analyzed the texts of budget reports from 2002 to 2021 by using TF-IDF method, and calculated the word frequency in the budget report. The keywords were generated after removing common English stop words and other words such as “per”, “cent”, “Hong”, “Kong”, etc. The top 50 words are:
expenditure(14), tax(13), revenue(9), development(9), industries(9), economic(9), services(9), economy(8), public(8), government(7), fiscal(7), financial(7), land(7),   forecast(7), growth(7), social(7), measures(7), propose(6), scheme(6), elderly(6), additional(6), market(6), estimate(6), increase(6), support(6), business(6), care(6),  reserves(6), community(6), education(6),  account(6),  industry(6),  mainland(6),  capital(6), fund(6), new(6), people(6), provide(5), operating(5), enterprises(5), gdp(5), tourism(5), resources(5), projects(5), proposal(5), health(5), trade(5), opportunities(5) , estimated(5), recurrent(5).

We also managed to generate a wordcloud of the Hong Kong Budget speech from 2002 to 2021. The wordcloud was created in terms of the result of TF-IDF method and removing some words to optimise the wordcloud visualisation. 

![GitHub](/images/wordcloud.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](https://ibb.co/CJcw7D2)

As shown in the wordcloud, the word “expenditure” and “tax” have been mentioned the most in the past 20 years with TF-IDF value of 14 and 13 respectively, and the word “revenue”, “development”, “industries”, “economic” and “services” followed in yellow color with the value of 9. In addition, the word “economy”, “public”, “government”, “fiscal”, “financial”, “land”, “measures”, “social”, “forecast” and “growth” ranked in the third place with high frequency in green color. From the figure we learned that “expenditure” and “tax” words are most mentioned in the 20-year budget which have always been the top priorities of Hong Kong’s budget reports.

In order to see the change of the importance ranking of these words in each year's budget report, we got the top 20 keywords with the high frequency in each year's budget according to the TF-IDF method, and formed the results into a table.

Format: ![Alt Text](https://ibb.co/rtzfzJ1)
![GitHub](/images/tfidf2.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](https://https://ibb.co/gzy3DWd)

From the table, we can see that the words "expenditure" and "tax" appear most frequently in the table with 17 times and 13 times respectively, which means that in the 20-year budgets, the word "expenditure" has been mentioned frequently in 17 years budgets except for 2008, 2009 and 2017, and it is worth mentioning that it ranks first for four consecutive years from 2002 to 2005, while the word "tax" comes in the top 20 in 13 years budgets except for 2002, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2017 and 2021, which ranks first for three consecutive years from 2007 to 2009.

There are many words that only appear once in this table. For example, the word "vehicles" ranks first in 2010, but it only appears once in the table which means that Hong Kong government began to emphasize vehicles in 2010 Hong Kong budget. It shows that vehicles or green economy is the unique concerns of 2010 which is an emerging issue that has not been paid attention to before 2010.

When applying the text-mining tools, we still used topic modeling to discover the hidden semantic structures in the text of Hong Kong budget. Given that 20 years Hong Kong budgets focus on several topics, we wanted to discover the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents. We also used k-means clustering and determined K=5, therefore, we extracted 5 topics with top 30 words describing each of them, a topic is intended here as a list of words that occur in statistically meaningful ways.

![GitHub](/images/topic3.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](https://ibb.co/nDN9Gm3)

From the left panel of the charts, we found that topic 1 and topic 3 are closer and seem to be in the same quadrant. Topic 1 mainly talks about economic and social development, which involves job opportunities, city resources, environment, education and other issues, while topic 3 is about public finances mainly involving financial expenditure, revenue, tax, reserves, deficit and other aspects. 

![GitHub](/images/topic2.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](https://ibb.co/bJZrmxn)

In terms of the right panel of the chart, Topic 2 mainly discusses about industries and enterprises, which involves financial services, business and trade, technology industry, logistic industry and other industries, especially focuses on their development.

![GitHub](/images/topic5.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](https://ibb.co/zNDG8hp)

According to the left panel of the charts, we also found that topic 4 and topic 5 are closer and almost in the same quadrant. Topic 4 mainly talks about government services, support and caring, which invloves elderly care, education funding, allowance and healthcare. Topic 5 is about city development and construction mainly involving land supply, facilities, tourism, housing supply, building and other aspects. 

In addition to finding the above five topics of focus on the Hong Kong budget in the past 20 years, we also wanted to figure out in-depth which topics have been continuously concerned about in all-year financial budgets, and which emerging topics have emerged with the development of time and society. We applied the cosine similarity measure to calculate the similarity between two paragraphs in the 20-year Hong Kong budget speech. 

By calculating the cosine similarity between paragraphs, we found that the similarity value of 1219 pairs of paragraghs are over 0.5, and the maximum similarity is even more than 0.95. There are 21 pairs whose cosine similarity value is greater that 0.8, and we went back to the original text and found that they are indeed highly similar, and these paragraphs mainly describe about medium range forecast, estimates, tax, fiscal reserves, public expenditure, rates, land resources, testing and certification services and other topics. Take tax text as example:
2007	
['Salaries Tax and Tax under Personal Assessment', "73.I propose to waive 50 percent of salaries tax and tax under personal assessment assessed for 2006-07, subject to a ceiling of $15,000. The amount waived will be deducted from the taxpayer's final tax payable for 2006-07. This proposal will cost the Government about $8.1 billion in 2007-08.']
2008
['Tax Reduction', "166.I now propose a one-off tax reduction of 75 per cent of salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for 2007-08, subject to a ceiling of $25,000.  The reduction will be reflected in the taxpayer's final tax payable for 2007-08. This proposal will cost the Government $12.4 billion in 2008-09 and benefit 1.4 million taxpayers. After the reduction, about a million taxpayers will pay no more than $5,000 in tax."]
2009
['Salaries Tax and Tax under Personal Assessment', "127.I propose a one-off tax reduction of 50 per cent of salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for 2008-09, subject to a ceiling of $6,000. The reduction will be reflected in the taxpayer's final tax payable for 2008-09. This proposal will cost the Government about $4.1 billion and benefit all 1.4 million taxpayers."]

From 2007 to 2009, several paragraphs on taxation are highly similar, so we speculated that tax issue is a platitude. According to the results of cosine similarity, three types of issues are distinguished which are enduring issues, emerging issues and transitory issues. We classified tax and land resources issues as enduring issues while testing and certification services issue as emerging issue. Therefore, We would like to classify some topics under the category of enduring issues, emerging issues and transitory issues, and make a more in-depth analysis and discussion on these topics.

##Endurng issue: Tax and land resources
###Tax
Since Hong Kong reunification in 1997, Hong Kong experienced a six-years adjustment period and began an uninterrupted expansion period. Tax as an important part in Hong Kong government’s income is an enduring issue. Looking at the detail, tax in HK includes salaries, personal assessment, profits, property, goods and services, etc. and some boundary of taxes. Every year, the government would listen to the public and consider the current situation to adjust the tax. Through the word frequency and TF-IDF, we found that “tax” ranked second in the 20 years’ word clouds and ranked higher during 2003 to 2009 and in 2015, 2016, 2018 to 2020. In addition, through the similarity analysis, we found that the content about salary, profit and property are highly similar in many years. In this case, we focus on analyzing these three taxes, and let other taxes as subfactors. 

Firstly, during 2003 to 2009, tax was very highly ranking in 2003 and 2007 to 2009. We took attention to these years’ tax changes and searched the relative information online. Hong Kong government increased the tax on salary, profits and property to the level of 1998/99 that around 1% and implemented in two equal phases in 2003-04 and 2004-05. Besides three basic taxes, motor vehicles first registration tax increased on the cars’ equipment and to the supplement. After this increase, the tax ushered in a stable stage until 2007.

From the figure above that captured from the budget speech 2011-12, GDP of Hong Kong had gained a bigger rise since the policies implement in 2003. In 2007, the government decided to make a series of tax relief measures to share the fruits of economic prosperity with the community. Under the relief measures, the three basic taxes were all decreased. Besides, the taxes of 2007/08 had planned to reduce in 2008, which is one-off reduction about 75 per cent of salaries tax and tax under personal assessment. Also, the tax allowances, tax bands were adjusted as regards inflation. However, for the financial crisis in 2008, Hong Kong was greatly affected on the business, economic, unemployment rate and many other fields. Also, from the figure, the GDP in 2008 has ushered in a new trough that almost the same as in 1998. In 2009, the government released the one-off tax reduction of 50 per cent on salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for 2008-09 with the ceiling of $6,000 which dropped a lot compared to last year. And in 2010, the reduction changed to 75 per cent for 2009/10. Furthermore, there are many other one-off reductions waiving rates applied to help the public counter the financial crisis. Under the help from government and the efforts of the whole Hong Kong people, the GDP of 2010 had risen quickly.

Then, turning to the year 2015, we did not find the title with tax in the speech, but there are related contents under the 13 titles. Two pieces of contents included the detailed and clear policy on the tax, and others talked about the small fields and some considering tax policy. The first title within “tax” contents is about the targeted support measures, which is the tax reduction policy to the catering industry, tourism, public transportation, and logistics. In the mid to the end 2014, Umbrella Movement had dealt a major blow to Hong Kong’s service industry, especially these targeted industries. Also, to the three basic taxes, salaries and profits tax has a decline about 75 per cent in relief measure for the public to allay burdens. Besides, to responding on the policy “One Belt One Road” and the other international development, the profits tax has targeted adjustment for the enterprises. After the Umbrella movement, the demonstration, resistance, and non-cooperation did not stop and went into the daily life, which cause the development stagnant and politically unstable. Considering these reasons, the government published the relief measure on salaries tax, tax under the personal assessment and profits tax that reduced 75 per cent in 2015-16. 

Moreover, “tax” has ranked highly in 2019 and 2020. In budget speech 2019, Paul Chan said “The uncertain global economic outlook this year will restrain Hong Kong's economic performance.  Having regard to the latest internal and external developments, I will make optimal use of the fiscal surplus for 2018-19 to introduce one-off measures to support enterprises and relieve people's burden.” In 2018, the global economy expanded with growth momentum in the first half year but affected by the trade tensions and other unfavourable conditions in the second half of the year. U.S. financial market has heightened volatility by the trade tensions with China and other countries; Eurozone economy had also slackened that affected by Brexit; Japan’s economy affected by natural disasters; the economy of Mainland, Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea were also slowing down. We found that for relieving stress of the public, one-off 75% tax reduction on salaries tax, tax under personal assessment and the profits tax was implemented. 

In the situation where external factors had not yet stabilized, the 2019-20 Hong Kong protests let the Hong Kong economy sound the alarm again. The unemployment rate of the retail, accommodation and food services sectors rose to 5.2% and to food and beverage services sectors even rose to 6.1%. In this case, 100 per cent tax reduction on salaries and personal assessment was applied to year 2019-20. At the same time, the profits tax had also reduced 100 per cent and property rate had been declined up to $5,000 in first two seasons and $1,500 in second two seasons in 2020-21. 

Between 2002 and 2021, Hong Kong government has adjusted the rate on many parts and implement some one-off policies to relief the public’s pressure on economic pressure. Besides 2010 and 2011, “tax” always be mentioned a lot in the budget speech, whatever in the practical measure, the plan of submitting a draft about tax, or the answer to the previous voice from the public. Tax is closely related to the public life and the income of government. 

###Land resources
Land source is global issue and enduring issue for a long time. Specially, in Hong Kong, land source is very precious for a large amount of people to live, to life, to work. Also, through the word cloud, “land” ranks 13 with 7.47, which is below the tax, industries, economic, services and public. Land source in Hong Kong mainly support for includes housing supply, commercial sites, and government, institution, or Community sites. Different usages have these own policies, and the income of land to the land fund is important for the government. 

![GitHub](/images/land.png)

Looking to every year’s TF-IDF, during 2011 to 2017 except 2012, “land” ranked highly, then the overall ranking dropped around 20 to 30 level. Before 2011, land resource has mentioned, but the property is small. As an enduring issue, land does not rank in top 20 before 2011, so what is the performance of land before 2011? At the early stage after the Hong Kong reunification, land fund is one of important part in fiscal reserves that government sold or rent the land for the business, real estate agent, or industries to gain the land fund. Besides, the land rate is top priority and adjusted for boosting economy. To these fields, land topic was mentioned in commercial and industrial sites. In 2008, efficient and flexible use of land resources was mentioned first time. John Tsang Chun-wah, the Hong Kong financial secretary during 2007 and 2017, said “With the continued upturn in our economy, demand for residential and commercial properties has increased, exerting upward pressure on both property prices and rent. The transaction prices of land at auction reflect market demand. In view of this, we will increase land supply.” Also, in 2009, a variety of commercial and residential sites and “hotel use only” sites were provided. The reason of implementing this policy is added that the economic downturn for the financial crisis in 2008-09. In addition, the government proposed to optimising land resources about revitalising old industrial buildings. Also, in 2010, Hong Kong government focused on the land utilization that change the idle government sites to industries buildings. To another side, we found there are many contents talking about the environment and land because of the mention to global environment issue. 

However, with more and more people were migrating to Hong Kong that increased the population growth, the land source become a serious issue to Hong Kong. Land issue was mentioned in 10 titles of total 72 in budget speech 2011-12. The most attention was to the residential sites, and then the commercial sites. “It is estimated that housing land available in the coming year will provide a total of 30,000 to 40,000 private residential flats, far exceeding the target of an annual average of 20,000 flats,” said by John Tsang, “In the five-year period starting from 2010-11, the forecast production of new PRH flats is about 75,000 flats. The new PRH flat production forecast for 2011-12 and 2012-13 will be some 11 200 flats and 16 700 flats respectively, of which about 84 per cent will be built in urban areas.” To the commercial sites, increasing office supply is top priority. In addition, revitalising industrial buildings was also mentioned for adopting green design, introducing environment-friendly and water conservation measures. Furthermore, infrastructure and the land for tourism also be put forward. 

Turning to 2013, Stabilising land supply became to the first-level title. Comparing with the 2011, the supply number has increased to a certain extent but not much. By 2014, land supply for residential sites, hotel use and room for business development are the focus point. Besides, the land support to the Art and culture came to a small title in 2015’s budget speech. We could find that the land resource issue in Hong Kong become more and more widespread. Except the basic issue on residential, commercial, and industrial, more and more land source are planned for building a liveable city. 

Through the TF-IDF table, we also found that “land” ranked first in 2016 and second in 2017. For the Belt and Road, the global business cooperation initiated by China in 2015, and the E-commerce booming in Hong Kong, the government supplied more land for logistics industry. Also, for the sustainable development of a liveable society, the basic land supply for the residential and commercial sites is necessary. With the detail number in the budget speech in 2017, the land supply on these two sides all have increased. After 2017, although land does not appear in the top 20 under TF-IDF method, land resources is still a big title in budget during 2018 to 2020.

“Increasing land and housing supply is one of the priorities of the Government…This is not an easy task.  On the one hand, the Government has to continue its endeavour to increase land supply on all fronts to meet the housing, economic and social development needs of Hong Kong. On the other hand, it is necessary for us to build up a land reserve to meet future demand in a timely manner,” said by Paul Chan during 2017 budget speech. 

##Emerging issue: Vehicles and testing and certification industy
###Vehicles
Regarding the emerging industries in the budget report, we found two interesting and attractive words, ‘vehicles’ and ‘testing and certification industry’.

In order to expand the scope of industries and create more employment opportunities, Hong Kong government actively allocates funds to expand the establishment and development of various industries. In the 20-year budget report, we found that Hong Kong government also vigorously encouraged and supported under a specific social background which led to the emergence of some new industries and the promotion of new products. For example, in response to a series of environmental protection measures launched by the government, new energy and environmentally friendly vehicles have replaced old diesel vehicles, and they have taken the lead in purchasing and demonstrating; take another example, the establishment of testing and certification organizations can not only improve the credibility and safety of the products themselves, but also protect the rights and interests of consumers from all over the world.

The first keyword is ‘vehicles’. We use TF-IDF ranking of the frequency of keywords each year, and found that in 2010 Hong Kong budget speech. "Traffic" defeated all other words and occupied the first place this year, but this was not significant in other years, which arouses our curiosity about this year's social background investigation.

Through our investigation, we found that 2010 was a calamitous year. The convening of the climate negotiations in Cancun, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in the United States, the forest fires in Russia, and the severe extreme weather in many European countries, have occurred a concentrated outbreak in 2010. Concerns about the climate and environment in various countries and regions have aroused the world's urgent attention to green, low-carbon, energy-saving and emission reduction. Of course the Hong Kong government is no exception. In 2010, it issued a series of measures to keep up with the pace of international environmental protection.

Therefore, in order to encourage the transportation industry to use low-polluting and low-carbon green transportation vehicles and related technologies, the Hong Kong government proposed to allocate 300 million to establish a green transportation pilot fund for the industry to apply for and start with public transportation. It introduced more green and innovative technologies, such as buses, minibuses, taxis and ferries that use environmentally friendly technologies so that related technologies have been germinated and developed in Hong Kong. In addition, the government has formulated a series of measures to eliminate old diesel commercial vehicles. In 2007, the government launched a plan to subsidize car owners to replace the more polluting pre-EU and Phase I diesel commercial vehicles with new cars which have less exhaust emissions. The plan will end at the end of March this year. In order to continue to speed up the phase-out of old diesel commercial vehicles, it will provide vehicle owners with a 36-month subsidy for the replacement of Euro II diesel commercial vehicles. The expenditure involved is about 540 million.

The spokesperson also suggested to speed up the capital expenditure andtax deduction for environmentally-friendly vehicles, so that enterprises can enjoy a 100% profit tax deduction in the first year, so as to encourage the business community to purchase electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles and other environmentally-friendly commercial vehicles more widely. Regarding the promotion of electric vehicles, the government established the "Steering Committee on Promoting the Use of Electric Vehicles" in April of 2009. The committee made a number of recommendations on strategies and specific measures to promote electric vehicles, one of them is that the government should take the lead in adopting more electric vehicles. The government has taken the lead in ordering 10 electric vehicles and planed to purchase 10 to 20 electric vehicles each year in the next few years. 10 electric motorcycles have also been introduced into the police fleet. In addition, in the private sector, the two power companies ordered more than 20 electric vehicles. In the next financial year, about 200 electric vehicles was supplied to the local market. The spokesperson expected that electric vehicles would be more widely used in Hong Kong.

The spokesperson said that the work on new charging facilities for electric vehicles is progressing well. The government has set up charging stations in nine government parking lots and will set up more than 20 more this year. In addition, the two power companies have begun to set up 28 charging stations in the parking lot one after another. The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department has also formulated guidelines on the installation of charging facilities in car parks to encourage private car park operators to provide charging facilities. The government and power companies will continue to expand their electric vehicle charging networks.

Taking into account the international social environment of the year, the Hong Kong government promulgated a series of measures to promote low-carbon and environmental protection in the transportation industry, and added a second phase of subsidy to encourage car owners to replace old diesel vehicles and take the lead in ordering electric vehicles to serve as a model to encourage citizens. It set up charging stations in parking lots and promised to continue to expand the electric vehicle charging network, in order to respond to the international community’s attention to the destruction of the climate and environment, and to fundamentally reduce the damage to the earth’s climate and environment caused by old vehicles.

###Testing and certification industy
As a popular international tourist city, Hong Kong has a long-standing reputation for medicinal materials and jewellery. With more and more tourists and denser population, the demand for goods is increasing, and it is also very important to ensure the authenticity and safety of goods. In October 2008, the Chief Executive established the Economic Opportunities Committee to monitor and evaluated the impact of the financial tsunami on local and global markets. After filter, six industries were have been selected, and the testing and certification industry was one of them. In September 2009, the government established the Hong Kong Testing and Certification Authority (Testing and Certification Authority) to provide advice on overall strategies and measures to promote the development of the testing and certification industry.

Through the investigation and calculation of the cosine similarity of 20 years' speeches, we found that the similarity between the 183th paragraphs in 2011 and the 103th paragraphs in 2012 was as high as 0.8246. In the budget speeches of 2011 and 2012, a new topic was mentioned. "Testing and certification industry" is a term that has not been mentioned in other years, so it belongs to an emerging industry which arouses our curiosity and thinking.

In the budget speech of 2011, it was mentioned that the government had accepted the market-led three-year industry development blueprint proposed by the Hong Kong Testing and Certification Authority. The bureau selected four industries: traditional Chinese medicine, food, building materials and jewelry, focusing on the development of testing and certification services, such as authenticity testing of Chinese medicinal materials, food safety system certification, building material product certification, and the development of standard testing methods for two types of jadeite, etc. Expansion of testing and certification services is also of great benefit to the improvement of Hong Kong’s overall reputation system. It not only greatly increased the protection of consumers' rights and interests, but also promoted the development of emerging companies related to testing and certification, and also increased new job opportunities.

The speech also stated that the government would participate in large-scale trade fairs and strengthen the promotion of Hong Kong's testing and certification services. In terms of opening up the mainland market, CEPA Supplement VII would be implemented. For the first time from 2011, Hong Kong testing agencies would be allowed to use Hong Kong-processed toys, circuit devices, information technology equipment and lighting equipment as pilot projects to undertake China’s compulsory products using testing of the certification system. This new measure could help local laboratories explore business opportunities and facilitate local processed products to enter the mainland market. It also stated that the government would assist the industry in implementing this pilot plan.

In the budget speech of 2012, the financial secretary mentioned that the government and the Hong Kong Bureau of Testing and Certification would work closely to implement a three-year industry development blueprint, enhance competitiveness, and strengthen the promotion of Hong Kong's testing and certification services. It also mentioned the promotion and development of new services for the four selected industries of Chinese medicine, construction materials, food and jewelry. However, compared with the plan in 2011, there were substantial new developments in different areas: in terms of Chinese medicine, the government was assisting laboratories to improve the testing level of Chinese medicinal materials. In terms of building materials, the government would strengthen the promotion of the advantages of product certification to the construction industry, and promote a number of new building material product certification schemes that were launched in recent years. In terms of food, the government subsidized the industry to develop food hygiene management system certification to suit the operation of the local catering industry and bring business opportunities for certification services. Regarding jewellery, Hong Kong established standard testing methods for jadeite jade, and planed to introduce standard testing methods for the remaining two types of jadeite next year. The Hong Kong Council for Testing and Certification also set up two new working groups this year to explore new business opportunities with the industry in the fields of environmental protection, information and communication technology. In the latest development of the mainland market, the four types of products processed in Hong Kong (IE toys, circuit devices, information technology equipment and lighting equipment) have been subject to China’s compulsory product certification system (CCC) by Hong Kong testing agencies since 2011. Through CEPA Supplement VIII, the scope of this pilot project will be fully expanded to the 23 types of products that need to be tested under the CCC system from this year, providing new opportunities for Hong Kong testing agencies to participate in the testing work in the Mainland.

Therefore, we found that in the 2011 budget speech, the four directions for the development of the testing and certification industry were mainly determined (Chinese medicinal material authenticity testing, food safety system certification, building material product certification, and the development of standard testing for two types of jade methods) and plans to open up the mainland market. In 2011, these plans have indeed been implemented in these four industries, and new progress and breakthroughs have been made. So in the 2012 speech, the progress of the testing and certification industry in 2011 was shown, and government decided to continue to expand business opportunities and further explored the mainland market on the basis of this development.

##Transitory issues: Epidemic and financial crisis
###Epidemic
Through TF-IDF and Topic modeling, we have observed that in the Hong Kong budget report from 2002 to 2021, social and economic issues such as epidemics and economic crises have certain periodic laws, and they are repeated at different times according to certain laws. According to the classification of different types of public events, this kind of topic that has a certain law and appears at different times is a transitory issues. Through TF-IDF and topic modeling, we can observe that health and welfare frequently appeared from 2003 to 2005， this is due to the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong in 2003. The epidemic caused 299 deaths, the city was paralyzed, schools were closed, and everyone went out with masks. In residential areas with severe epidemics, residents needed to be quarantined. The epidemic caused the economy to decline, recover once again to decline, and the unemployment rate rose to the peak since the transfer of autonomy, breaking through 8%.

First of all, due to the influence of Sars, Hong Kong faced huge challenges in terms of economy and people's livelihood. In the 2004 budget report, the Financial Secretary said that, “After taking into account the impact of the SARS outbreak on the economy, I announced in this Council on 22 October last year our new target for achieving fiscal balance.” In the 2007 financial report, the Financial Secretary mentioned that, “In August 2003, when I took up the office of Financial Secretary, Hong Kong was beset with severe challenges. After being successively hit by the Asian financial turmoil and the outbreak of SARS, the economy haddipped sharply.” And the same thing was mentioned in the Sustainability classification in the 2008 financial report. It can be seen that the impact of SARS not only caused a great threat to public health, but also caused severe damage to Hong Kong’s economy.

Finally, it is worth noting that epidemic ranks ninth in the TF-IDF of the 2020 budget report. Due to the catastrophic outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, the term was frequently mentioned. In the Economic Outlook for 2020 and Medium-term Outlook chapter of the 2020 fiscal report, the government stated that the COVID-19 has caused a serious blow to Hong Kong’s economic activities and sentiment, “Although the impact of the epidemic on our economy in the near term could possibly be greater than that of the SARS outbreak in 2003...Hong Kongs economicfundamentals remain solid and therefore our core competitiveness will not be shaken.” Due to the continuous impact of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) epidemic, the Hong Kong government’s fiscal reserves have fallen To more than 800 billion Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to 12 to 13 months of government expenditure, close to the level of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. It can be seen that with regard to infectious diseases in the Hong Kong financial report, the emergence of epidemics such as SARS and COVID-19 are cyclical. After a lapse of sixteen years, reflections and discussions about infectious diseases are still ongoing, and with the recurrence of infectious diseases, the financial reports are constantly being coordinated, compared and reflected.

###Financial crisis
In addition to the cyclical changes in the epidemic, the emergence of economic crises also has a certain cyclical law. By using TF-IDF, we can observe that crisis, employment, and challenges frequently appear in topic modeling in 2009. These three words appeared together in the Economy and Finance chapters.

It is worth noting that the emergence of financial crises is cyclical. Such recessions seem to occur every ten years or so in the modern economy. More specifically, they often seem to be accompanied by periods of strong growth. The worldwide financial crisis that broke out from 2007 to 2009 was a global crisis triggered by the US subprime mortgage crisis in 2007. The core area of ​​the crisis was in the United States, but it quickly spread to Europe and also spread to the vast emerging world market country.

Specifically, on September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers, a century-old investment bank in the United States, filed for bankruptcy protection, which was regarded as the beginning of the global financial tsunami. Global economic integration rapidly spread the crisis to various assets, various markets, and various economic systems. Although the market's worries about the collapse of the global financial system was subsided after governments took unprecedented measures, the impact of the financial tsunami evolved into a simultaneous global economic recession. Without exception, Hong Kong, as a metropolis of international trade, was the first to be hit hard by the economic crisis.

As mentioned in the 2009 fiscal budget report, “The financial crisis triggered by the US sub-prime mortgage problem is the most severe for the world economy since the Great Depression in the 1930s. We also need to be strategic in our thinking and have the ability inproblem solving so as to arrest as best we can the knock-on effects of the financial crisis ." The government put forward that the primary task was to stabilize the financial system and not allow systemic risks in the financial system. The second was to protect the living space of Hong Kong's small and medium-sized enterprises. The third aspect was to create employment. Stable employment is a prerequisite for stability. Finally, it is necessary to relieve the living pressure of the lower class and help those in need to tide over the difficulties. It can be seen that the government actively responded to the various impacts brought about by the economic crisis, and had been constantly reflecting on, reviewing and summarizing the causes and lessons of past economic crises.

Finally, in the International Co-operation chapter of the 2019 fiscal budget report, it is mentioned that "The financial tsunami in 2008 was the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s...the growth of the major advanced economies have not yet returned to the levels before the financial tsunami, and still need to rely on ultra-low interest rates or unconventional monetary policies." Given that the interest rates remain very low, there would be little room for introducing rescue measures if a major economic or financial crisis were to happen again. More importantly, the rise of nativism nowadays may make an international concerted effort and a swift response more difficult. Development has a certain sense of crisis. From 2008 to 2019, economic crises appeared in budget reports from time to time. It was not only the government's summary and overall planning of the economic crisis, but also the reflection on and prevention of the economic crisis. Moreover, Hong Kong also suffered from the Asian financial crisis in 1997. From this we can see that the frequency of economic crises mentioned in the government budget report has a certain periodicity.

The two aspects of the epidemic and the financial crisis have been repeated in accordance with certain rules in our Hong Kong budget report from 2002 to 2021. Therefore, it is obvious to say that these two topics are transitory issues.
